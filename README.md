*   **Intent Recognition (意图识别)**: Automatically parses natural language queries (e.g., "Find a divorce lawyer in Beijing") to extract key fields: Event, Location, Contact Person.
*   **Grounded Search (联网搜索)**: Uses **Gemini Search Tool** to perform real-time, grounded web searches for law firms and lawyer information.
*   **Structured Extraction (结构化清洗)**: Uses LLM streaming to convert unstructured search results into a clean table containing:
    *   Law Firm Name
    *   Contact Person
    *   Phone Number (Mobile-optimized **Click-to-Dial**)
    *   Address
    *   Source URL
*   **CSV Export**: One-click export of generated leads to `.csv` for Excel/CRM integration.

### 2. 💬 AI Legal Assistant (法律 AI 助手)
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Answers questions based on a curated Knowledge Base (articles, regulations, announcements) rather than hallucinations.
*   **Citation Support**: Provides source references for every claim generated by the model.
*   **Streaming Responses**: Real-time typing effect for better user experience.

### 3. 🧠 Multi-Model Engine (多模型支持)
